For years, I've been immersed in creating various projects, and a thought has been brewing for a while: how can I best share the technical journeys and a-ha! moments behind them? Well, last month, I finally brought that idea to life!

I'm thrilled to announce the launch of my brand-new project wiki – a dedicated space where I'm documenting the technical ins and outs of the creations I've developed over the years. Think of it as a peek behind the curtain, a place where I get to "show off" a little of the problem-solving and engineering that went into each one.

**What can you expect to find?**

This wiki is designed to be a technical deep dive. I’m laying out the methodologies, the challenges, and the solutions that shaped each project. But it’s not just about the explanations; where possible and published, I've made sure to include direct links to the **source code on platforms like GitHub** and even **3D files** for relevant projects. This way, you can go beyond just reading and actually explore the core components yourself.

Whether you're a fellow developer, a tech enthusiast, or just curious about how things are built, I'm hoping you'll find something of interest.

Creating this wiki has been an incredibly rewarding process. It's been a fantastic way to revisit past work, consolidate learnings, and create a valuable resource that (I hope!) others can benefit from.

I genuinely enjoyed every moment of putting this together, and I truly hope you'll enjoy exploring it just as much.

**Dive in and let me know what you think!** Just open https://wiki.mars3142.dev
