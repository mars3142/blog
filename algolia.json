To build a custom backend is a hard part, but to create secure user authentication is another story. For saving the user/game state you can use different approaches. In my case I wanted to use Firebase, but the primary authentication for Firebase is via email and password. This will be a two part tutorial for using Godot with Firebase with username and password.\u003c/p\u003e","tags":["tutorial","firebase"],"title":"Godot and Firebase","type":"post","url":"/2021/06/09/godot-and-firebase/","weight":0,"wordcount":529},{"author":null,"categories":null,"content":null,"date":-62135596800,"description":"","dir":"about/","excerpt_html":null,"excerpt_text":null,"expirydate":-62135596800,"fuzzywordcount":100,"html":null,"keywords":null,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"8576ec274c98b3831668a172fa632d80","permalink":"https://blog.mars3142.dev/about/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","readingtime":1,"relpermalink":"/about/","section":"","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"about-me\"\u003eAbout Me\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003ePeter Siegmund\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e is the owner of this page\u0026hellip;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo be continued\u0026hellip;\u003c/p\u003e","tags":null,"title":"","type":"page","url":"/about/","weight":0,"wordcount":13},{"author":null,"categories":null,"content":"Archive of historical posts.","date":-62135596800,"description":"Archive of historical posts.","dir":"archive/","excerpt_html":"Archive of historical posts.","excerpt_text":"Archive of historical posts.","expirydate":-62135596800,"fuzzywordcount":100,"html":"Archive of historical posts.","keywords":null,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"a06e5ce9eca4c3260843078104889780","permalink":"https://blog.mars3142.dev/archive/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","readingtime":0,"relpermalink":"/archive/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Posts Archive","type":"archive","url":"/archive/","weight":0,"wordcount":0}]
